##Iris Flower Classification

Overview

This project is a machine learning classification model designed to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements. The dataset includes three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Using the provided dataset, the model is trained to classify iris flowers accurately.

Dataset

The dataset consists of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width as features. Although Scikit-learn provides a built-in Iris dataset, you can also download it separately from other sources.

Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the necessary packages using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:

jupyter notebook "Iris Flower Classification.ipynb"

Follow the steps in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.

Dependencies

Python 3.x

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

Results

After training the model, it classifies iris flowers with high accuracy. The notebook contains visualization and evaluation metrics to analyze model performance.
