# Iris Flower Classification

# Overview

This project is a machine learning classification model designed to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements. The dataset includes three species:

  Setosa
  
  Versicolor
  
  Virginica

Using the provided dataset, the model is trained to classify iris flowers accurately.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width as features. Although Scikit-learn provides a built-in Iris dataset, you can also download it separately from other sources.


# Dependencies

Python 3.x

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

# Results

After training the model, it classifies iris flowers with high accuracy. The notebook contains visualization and evaluation metrics to analyze model performance.
